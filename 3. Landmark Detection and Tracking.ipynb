    "# Project 3:  Implement SLAM \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement SLAM for robot that moves and senses in a 2 dimensional, grid world!\n",
    "\n",
    "SLAM gives us a way to both localize a robot and build up a map of its environment as a robot moves and senses in real-time. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems. Since this localization and map-building relies on the visual sensing of landmarks, this is a computer vision problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using what you've learned about robot motion, representations of uncertainty in motion and sensing, and localization techniques, you will be tasked with defining a function, `slam`, which takes in six parameters as input and returns the vector `mu`. \n",
    "> `mu` contains the (x,y) coordinate locations of the robot as it moves, and the positions of landmarks that it senses in the world\n",
    "\n",
    "You can implement helper functions as you see fit, but your function must return `mu`. The vector, `mu`, should have (x, y) coordinates interlaced, for example, if there were 2 poses and 2 landmarks, `mu` will look like the following, where `P` is the robot position and `L` the landmark position:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mu =  matrix([[Px0],\n",
    "              [Py0],\n",
    "              [Px1],\n",
    "              [Py1],\n",
    "              [Lx0],\n",
    "              [Ly0],\n",
    "              [Lx1],\n",
    "              [Ly1]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that `mu` holds the poses first `(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ...,` then the landmark locations at the end of the matrix; we consider a `nx1` matrix to be a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real SLAM problem, you may be given a map that contains information about landmark locations, and in this example, we will make our own data using the `make_data` function, which generates a world grid with landmarks in it and then generates data by placing a robot in that world and moving and sensing over some numer of time steps. The `make_data` function relies on a correct implementation of robot move/sense functions, which, at this point, should be complete and in the `robot_class.py` file. The data is collected as an instantiated robot moves and senses in a world. Your SLAM function will take in this data as input. So, let's first create this data and explore how it represents the movement and sensor measurements that our robot takes.\n",

    "`data` holds the sensors measurements and motion of your robot over time. It stores the measurements as `data[i][0]` and the motion as `data[i][1]`.\n",

    "In fact, in the `helpers.py` file, you can read the details of how data is made with the `make_data` function. It should look very similar to the robot move/sense cycle you've seen in the first notebook."

Recall that `omega` holds the weights of each variable and `xi` holds the value of the sum of these variables, as seen in Notebook 2. You'll need the `world_size` to determine the starting pose of the robot in the world and fill in the initial values for `xi`."

    "### What to Expect\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data` that is generated is random, but you did specify the number, `N`, or time steps that the robot was expected to move and the `num_landmarks` in the world (which your implementation of `slam` should see and estimate a position for. Your robot should also start with an estimated pose in the very center of your square world, whose size is defined by `world_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these values in mind, you should expect to see a result that displays two lists:\n",
    "1. **Estimated poses**, a list of (x, y) pairs that is exactly `N` in length since this is how many motions your robot has taken. The very first pose should be the center of your world, i.e. `[50.000, 50.000]` for a world that is 100.0 in square size.\n",
    "2. **Estimated landmarks**, a list of landmark positions (x, y) that is exactly `num_landmarks` in length. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Landmark Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you refer back to the printout of *exact* landmark locations when this data was created, you should see values that are very similar to those coordinates, but not quite (since `slam` must account for noise in motion and measurement)."
